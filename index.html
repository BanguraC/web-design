   <h1><html>Computer science & BIT</html></h1>
   <p>Realization of these objectives requires systematic planning and careful implementation.
    To this effect, application of knowledge, skill, tools and techniques in the project environment,
    refers to project management. Project management in recent years has proliferated, reaching
    new heights of sophistication. It has emerged as a distinct area of management practices to
    meet the challenges of new economic environment, globalization process, rapid technological
    advancement, and quality concerns of the stakeholders.</p>

    <h1>Moudles</h1>
        <p>Project in general refers to a new endeavor with specific objective and varies so widely that it is
            very difficult to precisely define it. Some of the commonly quoted definitions are as follows.
            Project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service or result.
            (AMERICAN National Standard ANSI/PMI99-001-2004)
            Project is a unique process, consist of a set of coordinated and controlled activities with
            start and finish dates, undertaken to achieve an objective confirming to specific requirements,
            including the constraints of time cost and resource. 
            </p>

            <h1>Web & Development</h1>

            <p>Conception phase, starting with the seed of an idea, it covers identification of the
                product / service, Pre-feasibility, Feasibility studies and Appraisal and Approval. The project idea
                is conceptualized with initial considerations of all possible alternatives for achieving the project
                objectives. As the idea becomes established a proposal is developed setting out rationale,
                method, estimated costs, benefits and other details for appraisal of the stakeholders. After
                reaching a broad consensus on the proposal the feasibility dimensions are analyzed in detail.
                Planning Phase
                In this phase the project structure is planned based on project appraisal and approvals.
                Detailed plans for activity, finance, and resources are developed and integrated to the quality
                parameters. In the process major tasks need to be performed in this phase are
                • Identification of activities and their sequencing
                • Time frame for execution
                • Estimation and budgeting
                • Staffing
                A Detailed Project Report (DPR) specifying various aspects of the project is finalized to
                facilitate execution in this phase.</p>
                <h1>Static Analysis</h1>
                <p>Three major dimensions that define the project performance are scope, time, and resource.
                    These parameters are interrelated and interactive. The relationship generally represented as an
                    equilateral triangle. The relationship is shown in figure 1.
                    
                    It is evident that any change in any one of dimensions would affect the other. For example,
                    if the scope is enlarged, project would require more time for completion and the cost would also
                    go up. If time is reduced the scope and cost would also be required to be reduced. Similarly any
                    change in cost would be reflected in scope and time. Successful completion of the project would
                    require accomplishment of specified goals within scheduled time and budget. In recent years a
                    forth dimension, stakeholder satisfaction, is added to the project. However, the other school of
                    management argues that this dimension is an inherent part of the scope of the project that
                    defines the specifications to which the project is required to be implemented. Thus the
                    performance of a project is measured by the degree to which these three parameters (scope,
                    time and cost) are achieved.
                    Mathematically
                    Performance = f(Scope, Cost, Time)
                    
                    In management literature, this equilateral triangle is also referred as the “Quality
                    triangle” of the project.
                    
                    Project Life Cycle
                     Every project, from conception to completion, passes through various phases of a life
                    cycle synonym to life cycle of living beings. There is no universal consensus on the number of
                    phases in a project cycle. An understanding of the life cycle is important to successful completion
                    of the project as it facilitates to understand the logical sequence of events in the continuum of
                    progress from start to finish. Typical project consists of four phases- Conceptualization, Planning,</p>
